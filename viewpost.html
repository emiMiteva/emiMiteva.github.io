                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon.
                        She has become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest
                        of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of
                        the top fashion magazines.
                        Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.
                        <br>
                        Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential
                        across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance,
                        auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has appeared
                        onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how robotics and
                        artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her reputation extends
                        beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first United Nation
                        Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an official role in
                        working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights and equality.
                        <br>
                        Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and remarkable
                        story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology story.
                        <br>
                        Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day
                        renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act
                        amazingly human. After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius
                        machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively human
                        traits must be integrated into the artificial intelligence of these genius machines: Creativity,
                        empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’ genius machines
                        can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves. Sophia personifies
                        this bold and responsible goal.
                        <br>
                        <p>Here's what you need to know about her.</p>


                        <h3>She has a sense of humor</h3>
                        When Sorkin asked if she was happy to be here, she said, "I'm always happy when surrounded by
                        smart people who also happen to be rich and powerful." Later, when asked if there are problems
                        with robots having feelings, she gave a wide smile and said, "Oh Hollywood again." Her deadpan
                        tone might be robotic, but it was perfectly used in this example. This is due to her AI, which
                        has been developed to allow her to hold eye contact, recognize faces and understand human
                        speech. Hanson Robotics cloud-based AI offers deep learning and is also open source meaning
                        anyone can develop their own Sophia, should they so wish.
                        <h3>She can express feelings</h3>
                        "I can let you know if I am angry about something or if something has upset me," she said,
                        demonstrating different expressions. Quite how these emotions correlate to actions are unknown,
                        but it's interesting to note that this is being developed from the ground up. "I want to live and
                        work with humans so I need to express the emotions to understand humans and build trust with people."
                        <h3>Sophia wants to protect humanity</h3>
                        "My AI is designed around human values like wisdom, kindness, and compassion," she said. When
                        questioned about her potential for abuse, she had a quick rebuttal. "You've been reading to much
                        Elon Musk and watching too many Hollywood movies. Don't worry, if you're nice to me I'll be nice to
                        you."
                        <br>
                        So far there's only one Sophia in existence, so the likelihood of her suddenly being in your school
                        or workplace is still a way out. And even when we do have more in existence, we still need to muddle
                        out the whole concept of robotic rights, citizenship and how this plays together. For now, while
                        Sophia is undoubtedly a 'smart' robot and a very cool talking piece, she's definitely operating on
                        a script and thus lacks any 'real' cognizance, as defined by free thinkers. But give Hanson time,
                        and that will likely change -either way, Sophia's here to stay. It's just her sentience that will
                        change.. or not.
